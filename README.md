## Homiez Vision Statement

Homiez is an app designed to help people find their ideal rooms and roommates. The app will allow users to post room listings with profiles attached to them. Similar to a social media platform, these profiles will contain pictures, a short description, users’ interests, and some other useful information.

Homiez will work on a matching system where the party looking for a place will show their interest by sending a match request. The person who has posted the listing will be able to see everyone who is interested and choose to connect with the individuals for further discussions. Contact information will only be visible to both parties when matched.

The system will primarily be designed for two groups of users. The first group of users are those who are looking for a room to stay in. These users can browse through the postings and look at the user profiles attached to the postings. Once they find a listing that they like, they can proceed by sending a match request which the other party can respond to by accepting or declining.

The second group of users are those with rooms for rent. They can make a posting of the room, which contains information such as a description, location, price, current number of tenants, how long the room will be available for, and pictures of the room. They can also attach user profiles of the current tenants. This information will give others a good understanding of not only the room but the people living there.

Homiez will provide users with the capability of sorting postings based on location, price, and the number of interests that match with the profiles attached to the room. Users can also apply filters on profiles within postings based on criteria like age, occupation, and interests. Furthermore, machine learning integration to determine which interests work well together to prioritize the postings will be done in the future.

Nowadays people are forced to search for postings that are scattered all around the internet, making the hunt long and arduous. Besides, even after finding a potential match, they still must find out if the roommates are a good fit for them and their lifestyle. Homiez aims to solve all of these problems by providing everything in one place. Additionally, the matching system will ensure privacy by only displaying users’ contact information after they are matched.
The system will be considered a success based on the following criteria. First, how satisfied the users are with the experience. We will obtain this information by ensuring that the app has at least a 4-star rating on the Google Play Store and by surveying the people connected by the app who have lived together for at least 6 months. Second, at least 60% of room vacancies filled within a month after being posted. Third, time reduction in filling a room, there should be at least a 20% time reduction to find a roommate using Homiez compared to other systems.
